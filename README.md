# Goose Game
This is my personal solution to [Goose-Game kata](https://github.com/xpeppers/goose-game-kata) from Matteo Vaccari, you can find the original slides [here](https://www.slideshare.net/pierodibello/il-dilettevole-giuoco-delloca-coding-dojo).

Goose game is a game where two or more players move pieces around a track by rolling a die. The aim of the game is to reach square number sixty-three before any of the other players and avoid obstacles. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose))
